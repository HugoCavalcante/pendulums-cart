# pendulums-cart
Python scripts to describe and solve the movement of two pendulums on a free moving cart.

We study the movement of two pendulums mounted on a movable platform (cart). The cart is free to move along the horizontal direction thanks to small friction wheels, with steel ball bearings. The movement of the cart couples the movement of the pendulums, leading to phenomena such as chaos, synchrony and quasi-periodicity.
